    ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS provide a partition and 3 cluster fields whenever your table is larger 
	than the minimum byte charge size for bigquery, which is 10MB
    
    Creating partitions using ranges of numbers / partition has massive impact.
    Google allows 4000 partitions.

	If you create a partition with 1000 buckets, and qualify it in the queries,
	The cost for running the query approaches almost 1000 times less !!

	Cluster fields work amazing with partitions, but even without, they should be used.
